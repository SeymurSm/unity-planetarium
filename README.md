# Unity Planetarium Generator

![Demo 01](/img/demo_01.gif)

C# / Unity class for an accurate (~ -1째/+1째) generation of our universe (stars, planets, moon and the sun) depending on a given location (lat/long) and time.

The main script is *CelestialCoordinates.cs* - you can use it in your own project.

The script *CelestialManager.cs* is an example on how you can use the above script to generate a skymap corresponding to your location and time.

Note that we calculate the position of every objects from a given location on Earth, therefore planets will rotate around the Earth and not from the Sun.

## How it works

The class returns the horizontal coordinates (azimuth + altitude), in degrees, of a celestial object, by taking into account the given location and the current time.

For planets (Moon and Sun included), the methods return a Vector3 where **x = altitude (in 째), y = azimuth (in 째) and z = distance (in AU)** from Earth to the celestial object.
For stars, it returns a Vector2 with altitude and azimuth; the distance should be provided by the database you are using (i.e.: [HYG](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database))

For the stars, you will need its right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC). [The HYG database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database) contains the RA and DEC of almost 120'000 stars.

The latitude will be positive in North / negative in South. The longitude will be positive in East and negative in West.

Assuming that you want to get the coordinates of a celestial object above Beijing (Lat: 39.9 / Long: 116.4), for the current time:


```
// Get coordinates of the Moon when located in Beijing
// moon.x = altitude, moon.y = azimuth, moon.z = distance (in AU) from Earth to the Moon
Vector3 moon = CelestialCoordinates.CalculateHorizontalCoordinatesMoon(116.4f, 39.9f, DateTime.UtcNow);

// Get coordinates of Neptune when located in Beijing
Vector3 neptune = CelestialCoordinates.CalculateHorizontalCoordinatesPlanets(116.4f, 39.9f, Planet.NEPTUNE, DateTime.UtcNow);

//Get coordinates of Polaris (RA = 2.52975 / DEC = 89.264109) when located in Beijing
Vector2 polaris = CelestialCoordinates.CalculateHorizontalCoordinatesStar(116.4f, 39.9f, 2.52975f, 89.264109f, DateTime.UtcNow);

```

### From Altitude/Azimuth to Unity World Space

To convert your altitude and azimuth to your Unity world space, do the following:

```
Vector3 moon = CelestialCoordinates.CalculateHorizontalCoordinatesMoon(116.4f, 39.9f, DateTime.UtcNow);

Vector3 position = Quaternion.Euler(-moon.x, moon.y, 0) * new Vector3(0, 0, moon.z);
moonGO.transform.position = position;
```

You can also refer to the provided example script *CelestialManager.cs* for more information on how to use the results provided by CelestialCoordinates.
